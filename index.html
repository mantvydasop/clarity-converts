    <!-- VALUE FRAME -->
    <section id="value">
      <h2>Your product is smart. Your homepage should be too.</h2>

      <p>Clear enough for anyone to get it.</p>
      <p>Fast enough for them to care.</p>
      <p>Strong enough for them to act.</p>

      <p>You built something valuable. I make that value unmistakable.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- C.L.E.A.R. FRAME -->
    <section id="clear">
      <h2>C.L.E.A.R. – What your homepage must do</h2>

      <p>Your homepage has one job. Make the value of your product clear.</p>

      <h3>C – Capture the right people.</h3>
      <p>Instantly signal who this is for and what problem you solve.</p>

      <h3>L – Land the core value.</h3>
      <p>Make your main promise so sharp your buyer can repeat it back.</p>

      <h3>E – Eliminate confusion.</h3>
      <p>Cut internal language and fluff that slow decisions down.</p>

      <h3>A – Arm buyers with proof.</h3>
      <p>Show specific, credible evidence that you can deliver the outcome.</p>

      <h3>R – Remove friction to action.</h3>
      <p>Make the next step obvious, low risk, and aligned with how they buy.</p>

    <!-- P.R.O.O.F. PROCESS -->
    <section id="process">
      <h2>P.R.O.O.F. – How I turn complex products into conversion focused copy</h2>

      <p>You are not buying words. You are buying a system that makes your product easier to understand and easier to buy.</p>

      <h3>P – Probe the market.</h3>
      <p>
        Short, focused research to hear how buyers talk about the problem, what they compare you to,
        and what makes them switch. I use interviews when possible and when not I mine transcripts,
        reviews, support logs, founder notes, and competitor messaging.
      </p>

      <h3>R – Refine the message spine.</h3>
      <p>
        I map your messaging with Jobs To Be Done so we see moments, motivations, and switching triggers.
        Then I apply the Rule of One so the page rallies around one reader, one promise, one primary offer.
      </p>

      <h3>O – Orchestrate the page flow.</h3>
      <p>
        Using PCPO and CPTS I order the content so each section earns its place and naturally pulls the reader forward.
      </p>

      <h3>O – Optimize the words.</h3>
      <p>
        Every line has a job. To grab attention, build proof, remove a doubt, or drive action.
        No filler. No decoration. Just clean, persuasive language built for scanners.
      </p>

      <h3>F – Finalize, test, and hand off.</h3>
      <p>
        You get copy that is ready to ship. I deliver annotated Figma wireframes and a simple validation plan
        with clarity tests and lightweight analytics.

    <!-- PROOF -->
    <section id="proof">
      <h2>Proof of execution</h2>

      <p>
        You do not hire a conversion copywriter because they talk well.
        You hire them because they have shipped projects that made products easier to understand and easier to buy.
      </p>

      <p>
        See examples of homepages that went from vague to sharp, pricing pages that stopped confusing buyers,
        and messaging systems teams can reuse.

    <!-- ABOUT -->
    <section id="about">
      <h2>About Mantvydas</h2>

      <p>
        I am a conversion copywriter for B2B SaaS and AI companies, trained by Copy School with more than 17 credentials.
        Before specializing in conversion strategy I spent almost two years in B2B sales, running the full cycle from cold outreach to close.
      </p>

      <p>
        That background taught me how buyers think, how they make decisions inside teams, and how clarity speeds everything up.
        Every project starts with research, builds around proof, and ends with measurable clarity.
      </p>

      <h3>Beliefs I work by</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Clarity beats cleverness.</li>
        <li>Offers beat features.</li>
        <li>Proof beats claims.</li>
        <li>Testing beats guessing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How I operate</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Research first, then write.</li>
        <li>Ask sharper questions before touching a headline.</li>
        <li>Build messaging systems clients can reuse long after delivery.</li>
      </ul>
